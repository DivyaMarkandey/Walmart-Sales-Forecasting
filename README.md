# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
Through the analysis of Walmart sales data and the application of various statistical and machine learning techniques, several key insights have been uncovered:

# Impact of Holidays on Sales:

During major holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day, average weekly sales across all store types (Type A, Type B, Type C) were observed to be significantly higher compared to non-holiday weeks.
For instance, average weekly sales during holidays were approximately $152,780, whereas non-holiday weeks recorded an average of $131,490.

# Store Type Distribution:

The dataset revealed that store types are distributed as follows:
Type A: 44% of stores
Type B: 32% of stores
Type C: 24% of stores

 # Machine Learning Model Performance:

ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models were employed to forecast weekly sales with promising results:
ARIMA model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $3,620 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of $25,450.
Exponential Smoothing model performed slightly better with a MAE of $3,480 and MSE of $23,890.
Time Series Insights:

# Time series analysis revealed strong seasonal patterns and significant autocorrelation in weekly sales data, indicating the potential effectiveness of seasonal models like SARIMA for future forecasting tasks.
